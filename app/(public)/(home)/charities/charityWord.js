      <h4>
        From my initial conversations with the team to the support setting up
        our page and link, the experience as a partner of the Epilogue for
        Charities program has been friendly, efficient, and flexible. We've been
        pleased with the results of the program, and have realized quite a few
        gifts in Wills as a result.
