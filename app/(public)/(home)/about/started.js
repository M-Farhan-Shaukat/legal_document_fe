                  Like a lot of people, the need to have a Will really hit home
                  for us once we started having families of our own. And as
                  estate lawyers we saw a lot of people, young and old,
                  struggling to get theirs done. Everyone knew they should have
                  a Will, they just didn't feel they had the time or the
                  knowledge to get started.
                </p>
                <p className="description">
                  It's a process that's simple, affordable, and light on the
                  legal jargon. We hope you'll be inspired to finish your Will
                  here, so you can relax and get on to whatever it is we're sure
                  you'd rather be doing!
