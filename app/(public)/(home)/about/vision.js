                  Because everyone should have a Will

                  Yep, we know. Making a Will can be overwhelming - whether
                  you're just beginning or trying to finish it off. That's why
                  we started Epilogue. We wanted to provide a better way to make
                  a Will, so more people could do it.
                </p>
                <p className="description">
                  It's a process that's simple, affordable, and light on the
                  legal jargon. We hope you'll be inspired to finish your Will
                  here, so you can relax and get on to whatever it is we're sure
                  you'd rather be doing!
